<h2>
My name is Ryland J. Martz

I am interested in Software Development because I want to be a Game Developer
where I can create Video Games.

I want to know how to create Video Games and how to edit them to be
better.

I hope to learn how to stop cheaters and hackers
in Video Games.

Other hobbies I have outside of computers are scuba diving (only when the tempeture and attitude of the fish are good),
Watching Movies, ,and other hobbies

five of my favorite movie stars are: 

 * Dwayne Johnson
